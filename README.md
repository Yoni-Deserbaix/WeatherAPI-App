# WeatherAPI-App ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¶Ô∏è‚õÖ

WeatherAPI-app is an application designed to display real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeather API. Users can input a city name, and the application will showcase its weather conditions, humidity, temperature, and wind speed. This application was designed as part of my journey in computer development, aiming to acquire and enhance my skills in web development and server-side programming.

## Features

- Input a city name to retrieve real-time weather data.
- Displays weather conditions, humidity, temperature, and wind speed for the entered city.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

The project was developed using the following technologies:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Express.js

The use of Node.js and Express.js facilitated the implementation of server and stock and protect the api key and enhanced my back-end skills. üåü

## Usage

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YD-SavvyDev/WeatherAPI-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd WeatherAPI-app
    ```

3. Install the express module:

    ```bash
    npm install express
    ```

4. Create a `config.js` file inside the `public` directory with the following code:

   ![config.js code](https://github.com/YD-SavvyDev/WeatherAPI-App/blob/main/Screenshots/code-api-key.png)
   
   Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your real OpenWeather API key. This key is necessary to access the OpenWeather API for fetching weather data in your application. Once you've replaced it, your application should be able to make requests to the OpenWeather API successfully.

6. Start the application:

    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```

7. Open a web browser and access the application at `http://localhost:3000`. üåê

## Project Structure üìÅ

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the WeatherAPI-app.
- `style.css`: Holds the CSS styles for the application's user interface.
- `main.js`: Includes the JavaScript code responsible for fetching and displaying weather information.
- `server.js`: Utilizes Express to handle API requests and serve static files.
-  `main-get.js`: Reads the content of index.html asynchronously using Node.js fs and util modules.
- `public/config.js`: Stores the API key for accessing the OpenWeather API.

## Learning Objectives üìö

This project was an opportunity to improve the following skills:
- Improve my skills in web development and server-side programming with JavaScript and using frameworks such as Express.js.
- Utilisation d'API tiers (OpenWeather) pour r√©cup√©rer des donn√©es m√©t√©orologiques en temps r√©el.
- Gestion de la s√©curit√© des donn√©es sensibles en stockant la cl√© API dans un fichier de configuration externe.
